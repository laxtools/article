# Doing Math Well

 - memorize definition
   - know what to remember
   - know what to construct from intuition
   - construct definitions from understanding
 - understand proof in depth
 - build intuition from proof and definition
 - make problems and solve them with defs and intuition
 - repeat above

 There is no royal road in mathematics.
 There is no royal road in programming.

- do it anyway 
- lower expectation, and enjoy
- make it everywhere 



## Definition and Properties

 - understand definitions (concepts) by intuition
   - example: inf / sup
     - number from a ordered field
     - order! --> position
     - write down the definition by myself
       - construction.

   - example: field
     - it is like numbers we know
     - has 4 basic operations w/ addition, substraction, multiplication, division
     - we know that addition / substraction and multiplication / divions are operations of a group
     - and there is a relation w/ distributive law for addition and multiplication

   - concept can define objects and operations.
     - here we can visualize some.
     - 비유와 은유가 필요한 부분
     - 다른 직관을 속성을 통해 얻어야 함
     - 서술 자체로 기억하기는 어렵다.

 - understand properties
   - operations on the object
   - relations with other mathematical objects with functions
   - example: integration
     - it is a function to sum some value, i.e, length, area, or volume.

정의와 성질을 이해하는 과정을 반복하면서 직관을 형성한다.
이 과정이 가장 중요하다. 직관을 형성하려면 뇌를 훈련시켜서 "아하"라고
깨닫는 과정이 필요하다.
