# 2d voxel tree

Before developing 3d voxel tree, it is always a good exercise to try in 2d. Build a voxel tree with contour of arbitrary geometry that approximates polygons. Use it for: 

- path finding
- collision detection 



# visualization 

- edit a scene with closed polygons 
- voxelize 
- visualize collision and path finding
